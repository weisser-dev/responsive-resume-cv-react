dynamic content loading based on language preference.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Languages can be configured in `config.json`. Available languages are automatically loaded
  from this configuration.
- **Theme Detection and Selection**: The application can automatically detect the user's preferred theme (light or dark)
  based on browser settings (`defaultTheme: auto` in `config.json`) or allow for manual theme selection.
- **Downloadable PDF**: Users can download their resume as a PDF on desktop versions.
- **Customizable Sections**: Titles for each section can be specified in `locales.json`.
- **CV Information**: User CV information is entered into `cv.json`.
- **Profile Image**: The profile image can be set by replacing `profile.jpg` in the public assets.
- **Configurable Title**: The website title can be changed in the `/public/index.html` file within the `<title>` tag.
- **Base URL Independence**: The web app is configured to run without a "baseurl", making it easy to deploy on various
  platforms.
- **Deployment Ready**: A `deploy.yml` file for GitHub Pages is included for easy CI/CD setup.

### ToDoÂ´s:

- **CV Wizard**: Wizard which helps creating a new CV
- **More Themes**: Add additional Themes and more Themes options (like fonts for sections)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally in development mode, execute the following command:

`
npm run start`

To build the static content for production, use:

`npm run build`

## Configuration

- `config.json`: Configures the available languages and theme settings.
- `locales.json`: Contains the titles and content for each section in different languages.
- `cv.json`: Holds the personal information, education, experience, and other CV-related data.
- `themes`: Located in `/public/themes`, where you can customize or add new themes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, used for its scalability and
  developer experience.
- **HTML2Canvas**: A JavaScript library that allows for capturing the rendered HTML and styling of web components to
  generate images or PDFs.
- **jsPDF**: A library to generate PDF documents using JavaScript, enabling the download of the resume in PDF format.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Used for styling components with the ability to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and more for
  maintainable stylesheets.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), allowing automated building and deployment to
  GitHub Pages.
- **LocalStorage**: To persist user preferences like theme and language selection across sessions.

## Project Structure

- `/public`: Contains the static files like themes, `index.html`, and images.
- `/src`:
    - `/components`: React components for each section of the resume, such as education, experience, and skills.
    - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks, for example, `useLanguage` to manage language state.
    - `/models`: TypeScript interfaces and types defining the structure of the CV data.
    - `/utils`: Utility functions, including the local loader for loading JSON data.
    - `App.tsx`: The main React component that wraps the entire application.
    - `config.json`: Configuration file to set available languages and theme preferences.
    - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
- `/themes`: Directory inside `/public` where different CSS theme files are stored.
- `deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.
- `package.json`: Lists dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.

The project is structured to promote ease of maintenance, scalability, and separation of concerns. Each part of the
resume is a component that can be individually customized or replaced as needed.
